    <h1>Mexican Rice</h1>
    <img src="../images/MexicanRice.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mexican side dish made from white rice, tomato, garlic, onion, and perhaps other ingredients</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Long Grain White Rice</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Caldo de Tomate</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>The first step is to brown the rice by cooking it with some vegetable oil over a fairly high heat. When the rice starts to turn bright white and then golden, you’re ready for the next step, which is basically just adding the rest of the ingredients water, tomato sauce tomato bouillon, garlic and chili powder</li>
        <li>Once it all comes to a boil, cover it up and turn down the heat. A clear lid is helpful here so you can see when the rice is done, but really 20 minutes is about all it takes. If after 20 minutes there’s still some liquid in the pan, just let it continue to cook until all of the water is absorbed and you can no longer see it bubbling to the top</li>
        <li>Let it rest, covered, for several minutes, then fluff it up in the pan using a fork or wooden spoon, and you’re ready to serve. Sometimes I’ll add some frozen vegetables, like peas and carrots, or even chicken, like in my "One Pot Mexican Chicken & Rice"</li>
    </ol>
