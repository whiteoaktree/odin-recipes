<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>12 corn tortillas, preferably stale, or left out overnight to dry out a bit, quartered or cut into 6 wedges</li>
<li>Corn oil, or other neutral oil for frying</li>
<li>kosher salt</li>
<li>1 1/2 to 2 cups red chile sauce or salsa verde, store-bought or homemade (see end of recipe for homemade versions)</li>
<li>Sprigs of epazote, optional</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Fry the tortillas:
    In a large sauté pan, coat pan generously with corn oil, (1/8 inch), heat on medium high to high. When the oil is quite hot, add the tortillas, fry until golden brown.
    
    Remove tortillas to a paper towel lined plate to soak up excess oil. Sprinkle a little salt on the tortillas.
    
    Wipe pan clean of any browned bits of tortillas.</li>

    <li>Heat the salsa:
        Add 2 tablespoons of oil to pan, bring to high heat again. Add the salsa and let salsa cook for several minutes. If you have a few sprigs of epazote, add them to the salsa</li>
    <li>Add fried tortillas to the salsa:
        Add the fried tortilla quarters to the salsa. Gently turn over the pieces of tortilla until they are all well coated with salsa. Let cook for a few minutes more.
        
        Remove from heat. Serve chilaquiles with garnishes and fried eggs and beans or nopalitos.</li>
